"""Anthropic ↔ OpenAI-format request/response translation.

OpenRouter exposes an OpenAI-format ``/api/v1/chat/completions`` endpoint
(no Anthropic-Messages-compatible URL). To avoid rewriting every
Anthropic-shaped call site, we keep the internal request/response shape
Anthropic-native and translate only at the OpenRouter boundary.

The translator is intentionally functional — three pure helpers — so
the matrix of (system blocks, tool use, streaming tool fragments) is
testable in isolation without an HTTP client or an event loop.

What we DO NOT translate:

* ``cache_control`` blocks pass through unchanged when present. We
  preserve them on system content, user-turn content, and tool entries
  so OpenRouter can forward the Anthropic cache hints to the upstream
  Anthropic call (see OpenRouter prompt-caching docs:
  https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/best-practices/prompt-caching).
  For non-Anthropic slugs the feature_gate has already stripped them
  before we get here, so the no-cache_control path falls back to the
  legacy string-flatten form for maximum upstream compatibility.
* Anthropic thinking / output_config — NOT representable here. There is
  no OpenAI ``/chat/completions`` field this codebase can prove carries
  Anthropic's adaptive thinking or ``output_config.effort``, so we emit
  none. Every OpenAI-compatible FeatureSpec therefore sets
  ``supports_thinking=False`` and the gate removes both fields before we
  run (the provider logs the removal). If one still reaches us the gate
  was bypassed, and ``to_openai_request`` raises
  ``UnsupportedFeatureError`` rather than shipping a request that
  silently lacks the capability the caller asked for.
* Web-search server tools — feature_gate stripped these for non-Claude
  models before we ran. For Claude family (where feature_gate keeps them)
  the Anthropic ``web_search_*`` server tool can't be executed by
  OpenRouter as-is, so ``to_openai_request`` translates its *intent* into
  OpenRouter's ``plugins:[{"id":"web"}]`` web-search plugin (the tool
  itself is still dropped from ``tools[]`` — it has no ``input_schema``).
  See https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/features/plugins/web-search.
  OpenRouter's plugin injects search results inline and the model cites
  them with ``<cite index="...">…</cite>`` markup; the response path
  strips that markup so it doesn't leak into findings / chat text.
